# Wilds Combo Damage Calculator

This is a small and simple tool to compute the damage that a particular move
combination will output, given a particular weapon and decorations assigned to
it, for Monster Hunter Wilds.

The end goal is to make combos easily configurable so users can bring their own
playstyles, and make builds easily comparable so users can make their own
choices.

This calculator does NOT handle build creation (no knapsack solvers here!) For
that, I'd suggest you check out
[this simulator](https://mhwilds.wiki-db.com/sim/).

## Why?

I like playing games. I like programming. I like programming math for games.

Simple as.

## This tool should do X!

Feel free to contact me. Or, better yet, leave a PR!
